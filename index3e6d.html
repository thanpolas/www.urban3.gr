<p>2013 | competition | Budapest</p>
<p>The proposed strategy aims to drive the creek to a new future by recollecting its ancient memory of a productive place with a strong landscape identity. The new global identity of the creek is obtained thought a holistic design that will generate a public space system made of green surfaces and of clear and continuous interlaced serpentine paths. A cultural, leisure and educational hot spot with new actors and ever-changing urban rhythms will become a model case-study solution because of its easy adaptability reversibility and soft structure.</p>

<p>2013 | Competition | Thessaloniki</p>
<p>Eleftherias Square is an integral part of the commercial urban fabric of Thessaloniki. In our proposal we introduce a new ecosystem where plants, people, birds and water coexist, creating a new natural landscape in the city center. Special attention has been given to the lighting system designing different environments that create a feeling of safety and tranquility. The high quality of design and the improvement of the natural environment are expected to attract more users in the area, foster commercial activity and bolster the value of the area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>National competition for the renewal of the west docks in the Venetian Harbour</p>
<p>2010 | Competition | Heraklion</p>
<p>The competition carries the title ‘Reception-Starting Point’. The focal point of our proposal is a route &#8211; an extended public space with a start and an end, with centers of attraction for the visitors, with a network of small scale green spaces, with points for rest, with new entrances towards and from the project area. All these different networks and groups converse with each other having as a reference point the West and East Docks. The visitor comes closer to the city, learns for its past and its intense present, while the permanent resident finds a new space to express himself and reconnect with the city.</p>
