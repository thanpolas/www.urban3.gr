										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2009 | Master Thesis | London</p>
<p>A great part of London is built on the natural floodplain of the Thames. The risk from tidal flooding is expected to increase as a result of the gradual sea level rise due to global warming. At the edge of the floodrisk area is where we find the site of our project, Stepney. ‘’To Defend the Indefensible City’’ is an experimental tetralogy of fictional diaries which refers to the area of Stepney in a period of 40 years from 2020 to 2080. What we tried to investigate in our thesis is how through the shift of the designers’ perspectives towards a wider platform of actors, deeply influences and mutates the urban decision-making.</p>

<p>2011 | Research | Athens, London</p>
<p>The Polypolis game was initially conceived as a testing ground for SARCHA’s “CCR Athens Gerani 2010” pilot study. Four different groups of players strive to resolve complex issues related to the existing human/physical/natural resources within city blocks. As the current economic crisis hits a number of European countries, Polypolis social game takes a life on its own; it uses a playful manner to train/educate city inhabitants to cope ‘in common’ with issues that affect their life’s resources. Local adaptations have been developed for Athens, Rome and Thessaloniki. Polypolis Athens was the official participation of Greece at the London Festival of Architecture 2012.</p>

<p>2010 | Research | Athens<b></b></p>
<p>SARCHA’s research team worked in Gerani neighbourhood exploring the urban accumulation of city resources. The data collected was classified in three categories, human, physical and natural resources and transferred onto multilayered maps. The 243 buildings in the (10.9 Ha) area belong to more than 3.753 private owners and present a distinct vertical differentiation of uses. Our Resources Reset Proposal aims to recombine the area’s building stock, human potential and manufacturing tradition with innovation to create a small scale production hub. To this end, SARCHA proposes the administration of resources ‘in common’ and puts forward the appropriate tools for the active involvement of inhabitants and owners alike.</p>
